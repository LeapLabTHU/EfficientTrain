## Overview

In this paper, we present a novel curriculum learning approach for the efficient training of visual backbones. Our algorithm, *EfficientTrain*, is simple, general, yet surprisingly effective. For example, it reduces the training time of a wide variety of popular models (e.g., ConvNeXts, DeiT, PVT, and Swin/CSWin Transformers) by more than 1.5Ã— on ImageNet-1K/22K without sacrificing the accuracy. It is effective for self-supervised learning (i.e., MAE) as well.
